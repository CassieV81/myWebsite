## About
I built this project as a way to learn how to create a website using Angular. Throughout the development process, I aimed to understand Angular's core concepts, such as components, modules, services, and routing. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in front-end development and enhance my skills in building interactive and responsive web applications.

## Technologies
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- Angular: Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source framework for building client-side web applications. It provides a robust structure for developing dynamic single-page applications (SPAs).
- Formspree: Formspree is a service that allows you to easily handle form submissions on your static website. I integrated Formspree into this project to enable email communication with visitors who fill out the contact form on the website.
