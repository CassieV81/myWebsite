    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate technologist with a rich background in Statistics and Sustainable Business and Technology. My journey began as a curious self-taught programmer, leading me to the development of an innovative software application for my thesis. Currently, I am enriching my experience as a student assistant in software development, where I've honed my skills through practical applications in real-world projects.</p>
    <p>Holding a Bachelor of Engineering in both Statistics and Sustainable Business and Technology, my educational path has been diverse and enlightening. This unique combination has equipped me with a deep understanding of data analytics and sustainability principles, allowing me to integrate these insights into software development projects.</p>
    <p>My professional experience includes a significant role in the GreenTwin project, where I developed a contract management script using Python to enhance sustainable logistics through an AI-enhanced decentralized marketplace. This role not only improved my technical skills but also allowed me to contribute to sustainability efforts. Additionally, my internship at FANUC Europe Corporation honed my problem-solving and team collaboration skills, further enhancing my IT support capabilities.</p>
    <p>I excel in programming languages such as JavaScript and Python, and I am proficient in web development using HTML and CSS. My projects showcase my ability to blend technical skills with innovative solutions, such as the development of a message-based software for processing Cypher Social Contracts, which integrates conversational AI to improve user experience.</p>
    <p>My commitment to continuous learning drives me to expand my knowledge in programming, data structures, and algorithms. My GitHub profile, <a href="https://github.com/CassieV81" target="_blank">CassieV81</a>, serves as a testament to my dedication and showcases various projects that underline my programming prowess and creative problem-solving skills.</p>
